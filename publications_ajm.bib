	abstract = {Human cells cultivated in a microfluidic system provide an interesting alternative for animal experiments in drug screening. For these tests, a pumpless system based on hydrostatic pressure could be used for drug delivery. The objective of this paper is to provide a method to analyze drug distribution in a gravity-driven microfluidic system to reduce the design cycle of these systems. The approach is based on an analytical model combined with a finite element method (FEM). The paper presents simulation of gravity-driven drug delivery in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic cell culture system. In the study, a simple but commonly used system including two reservoirs, inlet and outlet, connected through a microchannel, is modeled. In the proposed method, time-dependent working pressure based on hydrostatic and capillary pressures is first approximated analytically. Secondly, using the calculated pressure, a velocity profile of single-phase fluid flow is solved across the system using the FEM. Finally, a distribution of a selected drug compound over the system is simulated and analyzed. Based on the results, the initial geometry is improved for better performance. The paper demonstrates how the modified system provides faster and more uniform drug concentration profile on the cells compared to the initial structure.},

	abstract = {Ischemic heart disease is a major cause of death worldwide, and the only available therapy to salvage the tissue is reperfusion, which can initially cause further damage. Many therapeutics that have been promising in animal models have failed in human trials. Thus, functional human based cardiac ischemia models are required. In this study, a human induced pluripotent stem cell derived-cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM)-based platform for modeling ischemia–reperfusion was developed utilizing a system enabling precise control over oxygen concentration and real-time monitoring of the oxygen dynamics as well as iPS-CM functionality. In addition, morphology and expression of hypoxia-related genes and proteins were evaluated as hiPSC-CM response to 8 or 24 h hypoxia and 24 h reoxygenation. During hypoxia, initial decrease in hiPSC-CM beating frequency was observed, after which the CMs adapted to the conditions and the beating frequency gradually increased already before reoxygenation. During reoxygenation, the beating frequency typically first surpassed the baseline before settling down to the values close the baseline. Furthermore, slowing on the field potential propagation throughout the hiPSC-CM sheet as well as increase in depolarization time and decrease in overall field potential duration were observed during hypoxia. These changes were reversed during reoxygenation. Disorganization of sarcomere structures was observed after hypoxia and reoxygenation, supported by decrease in the expression of sarcomeric proteins. Furthermore, increase in the expression of gene encoding glucose transporter 1 was observed. These findings indicate, that despite their immature phenotype, hiPSC-CMs can be utilized in modeling ischemia–reperfusion injury.},

	abstract = {Maintaining a proper pH level is crucial for successful cell culturing. Mammalian cells are commonly cultured in incubators, where the cell culture medium is saturated with a mixture of air and 5\% carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, to keep cell culture medium pH in an acceptable level outside these incubators, a suitable CO2 concentration must be dissolved in the medium. However, it can be very difficult to control and measure precisely local concentration levels. Furthermore, possible undesired concentration gradients generated during long-term cell culturing are almost impossible to detect. Therefore, we have developed a computational model to estimate CO2 transport in silicone-based microfluidic devices. An extensive set of experiments was used to validate the finite element model. The model parameters were obtained using suitable measurement set-ups and the model was validated using a fully functional cell cultivation device. The predictions obtained by the simulations show very good responses to experiments. It is shown in this paper how the model helps to understand the dynamics of CO2 transport in silicone-based cell culturing devices possessing different geometries, thus providing cost-effective means for studying different device designs under a variety of experimental conditions without the need of actual testing. Finally, based on the results from the computational model, an alternative strategy for feeding CO2 is proposed to accelerate the system performance such that a faster and more uniform CO2 concentration response is achieved in the area of interest.},

	abstract = {Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Preserving functionality and preventing arrhythmias of the heart are key principles in the management of patients with IHD. Levosimendan, a unique calcium (Ca2+) enhancer with inotropic activity, has been introduced into clinical usage for heart failure treatment. Human-induced pluripotent cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offer an opportunity to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease as well as to serve as a platform for drug screening. Here, we developed an in vitro IHD model using hiPSC-CMs in hypoxic conditions and defined the effects of the subsequent hypoxic stress on CMs functionality. Furthermore, the effect of levosimendan on hiPSC-CMs functionality was evaluated during and after hypoxic stress. The morphology, contractile, Ca2+-handling, and gene expression properties of hiPSC-CMs were investigated in response to hypoxia. Hypoxia resulted in significant cardiac arrhythmia and decreased Ca2+ transient amplitude. In addition, disorganization of sarcomere structure was observed after hypoxia induction. Interestingly, levosimendan presented significant antiarrhythmic properties, as the arrhythmia was abolished or markedly reduced with levosimendan treatment either during or after the hypoxic stress. Moreover, levosimendan presented significant protection from the sarcomere alterations induced by hypoxia. In conclusion, this chip model appears to be a suitable preclinical representation of IHD. With this hypoxia platform, detailed knowledge of the disease pathophysiology can be obtained. The antiarrhythmic effect of levosimendan was clearly observed, suggesting a possible new clinical use for the drug.},

	abstract = {The vasculature is an essential, physiological element in virtually all human tissues. Formation of perfusable vasculature is therefore crucial for reliable tissue modeling. Three-dimensional vascular networks can be formed through the co-culture of endothelial cells (ECs) with stromal cells embedded in hydrogel. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow (BMSCs) and adipose tissue (ASCs) are an attractive choice as stromal cells due to their natural perivascular localization and ability to support formation of mature and stable microvessels in vitro. So far, BMSCs and ASCs have been compared as vasculature-supporting cells in static cultures. In this study, BMSCs and ASCs were co-cultured with endothelial cells in a fibrin hydrogel in a perfusable microfluidic chip. We demonstrated that using MSCs of different origin resulted in vascular networks with distinct phenotypes. Both types of MSCs supported formation of mature and interconnected microvascular networks-on-a-chip. However, BMSCs induced formation of fully perfusable microvasculature with larger vessel area and length whereas ASCs resulted in partially perfusable microvascular networks. Immunostainings revealed that BMSCs outperformed ASCs in pericytic characteristics. Moreover, co-culture with BMSCs resulted in significantly higher expression levels of endothelial and pericyte-specific genes, as well as genes involved in vasculature maturation. Overall, our study provides valuable knowledge on the properties of MSCs as vasculature-supporting cells and highlights the importance of choosing the application-specific stromal cell source for vascularized organotypic models.},

Therefore, we propose a new analytical model to estimate the generated flow rates.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Typically, live cell analyses are performed outside an incubator in an ambient air, where the lack of sufficient CO2 supply results in a fast change of pH and the high evaporation causes concentration drifts in the culture medium. That limits the experiment time for tens of minutes. In many applications, e.g. in neurotoxicity studies, a prolonged measurement of extracellular activity is, however, essential. NEW METHOD We demonstrate a simple cell culture chamber that enables stable culture conditions during prolonged extracellular recordings on a microelectrode array (MEA) outside an incubator. The proposed chamber consists of a gas permeable silicone structure that enables gas transfer into the chamber. RESULTS We show that the culture chamber supports the growth of the human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neurons both inside and outside an incubator. The structure provides very low evaporation, stable pH and osmolarity, and maintains strong signaling of hESC-derived neuronal networks over three-day MEA experiments. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS Existing systems are typically complex including continuous perfusion of medium or relatively large amount of gas to supply. The proposed chamber requires only a supply of very low flow rate (1.5ml/min) of non-humidified 5\% CO2 gas. Utilizing dry gas supply makes the proposed chamber simple to use. CONCLUSION Using the proposed culture structure on top of MEA, we can maintain hESC-derived neural networks over three days outside an incubator. Technically, the structure requires very low flow rate of dry gas supporting, however, low evaporation and maintaining the pH of the culture.},

	abstract = {Gravity-driven flow is an attractive approach to de- velop simpler microfluidic systems. Because clogged microchan- nels could easily lead to fatal operational failures, it is crucial to monitor flow rate in these systems. Therefore, we propose here for the first time a numerical model that combines a calorimetric flow sensor and a gravity-driven system. With the validated model, we studied the flow behavior in a gravity-driven system. Furthermore, we were able to improve the sensitivity of the measurement based on simulation results. This demonstrates, how the model could be used as an effective optimization tool in the gravity-driven system including calorimetric flow measurement.},
